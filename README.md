# waveshare-esp32-c6-lcd-1.47

My collection of projects using the Waveshare ESP32-C6 w/ LCD 1.47" display.

## Conway's Game of Life

Forked from [georgik/esp32-conways-game-of-life-rs](https://github.com/georgik/esp32-conways-game-of-life-rs/tree/main). This was the first example project I found using the Waveshare ESP32-C6 w/ LCD 1.47" display, and will probably serve as the basis for other projects going forward. It uses `no_std` and `esp-hal` to run on the ESP32-C6, along with `bevy_ecs` to render the game.
